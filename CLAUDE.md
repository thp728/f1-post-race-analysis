# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Post-race Formula 1 analysis toolkit. Loads race data, computes performance metrics, generates predictions for the next race, and serves results via a Streamlit dashboard. Blog-ready chart exports feed a separate Astro-based GitHub Pages site.

This is a learning project — educational focus, not production-grade. Prioritise clarity and correctness over abstraction.

## Architecture

### Data Source Strategy

- **FastF1 (primary)** — all session data: laps, sectors, telemetry, tyre compounds, weather, race control messages. Covers 2018–present. Already uses Jolpica-F1 internally for results/standings.
- **Jolpica-F1 (direct, only when needed)** — for pre-2018 historical data (Elo ratings, long-term trend features). API at `api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1/`, 200 req/hr limit.
- **OpenF1** — not currently used. Only add if building a REST-based frontend or needing overtake/team radio data.
- **F1DB** — not currently used. Only add for multi-decade ML feature sets.

Do not add new data sources without a concrete use case.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Dashboard is the primary analysis interface**, not notebooks. If analysis is repeatable week-to-week, it belongs in the dashboard. Notebooks are scratch space for one-off investigations only.
- **Notebooks import from `src/`** — never duplicate logic. If you copy-paste code between notebooks, extract it into `src/`.
- **If a notebook exploration pattern proves generally useful, promote it**: move the logic to `src/`, add a dashboard page, delete the notebook.
- **Own database (SQLite)** stores processed data. FastF1's cache is a download cache, not an analytical database. The SQLite DB enables cross-race queries, rolling aggregations, and pre-computed metrics without reloading sessions.
- **SQLite only** — no Parquet files. One storage layer keeps things simple for a learning project.
- **Two-repo setup**: this repo is the analysis workbench. A separate repo (`f1-blog`) hosts the Astro-based GitHub Pages site. `exports/` in this repo contains PNGs that get copied to the blog repo's `src/assets/`.

## Common Commands

```bash
uv sync                                  # Install all dependencies from lockfile
uv run streamlit run dashboard/app.py    # Run dashboard
uv run jupyter lab                       # Run notebooks
uv add <package>                         # Add new dependency
uv run python scripts/post_race_etl.py --year YYYY --round N             # Full weekend (FP1-R)
uv run python scripts/post_race_etl.py --year YYYY --round N --session FP1     # Single session
uv run python scripts/post_race_etl.py --year YYYY --round N --session FP1,FP2 # Multiple sessions
uv run python scripts/export_blog_charts.py  # Export PNGs for blog
uv run pytest tests/                     # Run tests
```

## Package Management

Uses **uv** (not pip/venv/conda).

- `pyproject.toml` declares dependencies
- `uv.lock` pins exact versions (always commit this)
- `.venv/` is the local virtual environment (gitignored)
- Python version pinned via `uv python pin` in project root

## Core Dependencies

- `fastf1` — F1 data loading and session management
- `pandas`, `numpy` — data processing
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — static visualisation
- `plotly` — interactive charts
- `scipy` — curve fitting (degradation slopes)
- `scikit-learn` — predictive modelling
- `streamlit` — dashboard framework
- `jupyterlab` — notebook exploration

## Data Conventions

### SQLite Storage

- Lap/sector times stored as INTEGER milliseconds (not float seconds or timedelta)
- Convert at boundaries: `_timedelta_to_ms()` for writes, `ms / 1000.0` for reads
- Laps, stints, and weather tables include a `session_type` column (R/Q/FP1/FP2/FP3)
- ETL defaults to full weekend (FP1, FP2, FP3, Q, R); use `--session` to load specific sessions

### FastF1 Caching

Always enable before any session load:

```python
fastf1.Cache.enable_cache('data/f1_cache')
```

### Lap Filtering

- Use `metrics.filter_clean_laps()` for pace analysis on SQLite DataFrames — removes pit laps, inaccurate laps, and outliers (>107% of fastest)
- When working with FastF1 objects directly, use `pick_quicklaps(threshold=1.07)` and `pick_accurate()`
- Always filter out in-laps and out-laps for degradation calculations

### Tyre Compounds

FastF1 reports SOFT/MEDIUM/HARD — not the underlying Pirelli C1–C5 specification. Cross-race tyre comparisons require external knowledge of compound allocation per event. Do not assume MEDIUM at Bahrain equals MEDIUM at Monza.

### Fuel Correction

Approximate fuel effect: **~0.06 s/lap** improvement from fuel burn. Subtract this from raw degradation slope to isolate tyre-only degradation.

### Normalisation for Cross-Race Comparison

Never compare raw lap times across circuits. Use percentage gap to session leader:

```python
pct_gap = 100 * (driver_time - leader_time) / leader_time
```

## Analysis Techniques Implemented

All implementations live in `src/`. Dashboard pages and export scripts call these — never reimplement.

1. **Tyre degradation** (`metrics.py`) — linear regression of lap time vs tyre age per compound per driver. Fuel-corrected. Cliff detection via rolling window threshold.
2. **Sector breakdown** (`metrics.py`) — sector-by-sector comparison, theoretical best lap, speed trap analysis.
3. **Pace delta** (`metrics.py`) — lap-by-lap gap evolution, stint-adjusted mean pace per driver.
4. **Pit strategy** (`strategy.py`) — stint timeline visualisation, undercut/overcut detection by comparing pit lap timing and position changes.
5. **Safety car impact** (`strategy.py`) — identify SC/VSC periods from race control messages or TrackStatus codes, flag drivers who pitted under SC.
6. **Consistency metrics** (`metrics.py`) — standard deviation, IQR, coefficient of variation of clean lap times per driver.

## Prediction Model

Weighted scoring model combining:

- Recent form — rolling avg finish position, last 5 races (weight: 0.40)
- Circuit history — avg finish at this specific circuit, last 3 visits (weight: 0.25)
- Circuit cluster form — avg finish at same circuit type this season (weight: 0.15)
- Pit stop consistency — std of pit stop durations (weight: 0.10)
- Qualifying conversion — avg positions gained/lost grid-to-finish (weight: 0.10)

Circuit clusters: night/desert, fast street, tight/low-overtaking, classic high-speed, straight-line dominant.

**Known limitations (do not try to model these):**

- Mid-season upgrades can shift competitiveness 0.3–0.5s overnight
- Street circuits produce outlier results
- Early-season predictions are unreliable (< 3 races of data)
- Driver team changes break historical continuity
- Regulation changes reset the competitive order

## Content Pipeline

Weekly cadence per race:

1. Run `scripts/post_race_etl.py --year YYYY --round N` after the race (loads full weekend: FP1–R; use `--session FP1` to load a specific session)
2. Open dashboard — standard analysis is auto-generated from SQLite
3. Run `scripts/export_blog_charts.py --year YYYY --round N` for blog PNGs
4. Write blog post in the `f1-blog` repo referencing exported charts
5. Optionally: explore specific questions in `notebooks/scratch.ipynb`

Two content formats per race week:

- **Post-race analysis + next-race prediction** (Monday/Tuesday)
- **Prediction review** (after the next race — what the model got right/wrong)

## Code Style

- Type hints on all `src/` functions
- Docstrings on public functions (one-liner minimum)
- No logic in dashboard pages — they call `src/` and `components/charts.py`
- Prefer explicit over clever — this is a learning project

## .gitignore Must Include
